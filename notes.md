# Here are a few notes and ideas for future writings

Emphasize how much cheaper it is to live, and how much labor is currently being stolen from you. I think this is a major concept that can be hard to understand the magnitude of. This makes it much more possible to see that a new system is _extremely_ desirable. An idea that I encountered at one point was doing some sort of interactive calculator to show people this.

Explaining in depth why ownership of private property/capital is illegitimate and must be violently enforced, and how people can make money off doing nothing and this is illegitimate. This is one of the largest sources of the unnatural accumulation of wealth, simply diverse forms of usury, shown in absentee landlordism and interest rates and such. If we don't do this there's a slight risk of appearing as "anarcho" capitalist and this is definitely not right.

Speaking of the unnatural accumulation of wealth. A potential analogy could be to question the validity of Elon Musk's wealth: he has 25,000,000x as much wealth as the median American. Is he really 25,000,000 more productive than the median American? Similarly this could be a good introduction or allusion to the Labor Theory of Value. Again, this is an incredibly hard topic to see; many Americans genuinely believe that a billionaire is actually worth 25,000,000x as much to the economy as the median American, they believe that his value is there in providing jobs, that he's some "elite" genius responsible for the wealth of America. Another way of thinking about is how human qualities and many other things in the natural world follow Normal distributions, yet for some reason wealth follows a power rule, and the reason for this lies in the illegitimate accumulation of wealth.

The most important monopolies are sometimes the hardest ones to see, such as private land ownership leading to coercion through usury. Similarly to see how large companies are subsidized by tax dollars can sometimes be very counter-intuitive and hard to see.

There are too many questions with diverse answers to cover all in the FAQ. To be able to answer these, I'll set up a Gemini Gem with instructions to be able to answer these questions comprehensively, such as "What happens if somebody wants to build a nuclear plant?" or "Structural engineering firms exist mostly to make buildings safe and follow code. What happens to a structural engineering firm, and wouldn't buildings just fall apart in the next earthquake if there's nobody to regulate them?" I think the Objections / FAQ page could be centered around this, with the most common or general objections already prefired.

An overall theme here is that this is an incredibly hard set of ideas to comprehend, even when we have ideals of a free market. I don't know how exactly to get people to this point; getting myself, an open-minded, unprogrammed teenager to see this took a lot of examining the problems of the mechanisms of capitalism and exploring the alternatives like state socialism.

"State Socialism and Anarchism" by Benjamin Tucker is a great essay to cool fears about communism, alluding to history of anti-capitalist movements and the opposition of authoritarian left and libertarian left.

Also for slightly more context to show you how much I care about this stuff, this is my opinion on the world: Capitalism being discovered and utilized was a beautiful thing. I can't remember who exactly said it, but there's a quote about capitalism being "the end of history". I agree, markets are amazing. Adam Smith knew this. But they had one fatal flaw, and that was the accumulation of wealth. And that leads to all sorts of downstream effects. By the 19th century, this flaw became visible, and post-capitalists began examining it. Two competing ideas from the left emerged from Marx and Proudhon: authoritarian socialism and anarchism. I think the essay "State Socialism and Anarchism" by Benjamin Tucker explains this the best. Marx captured the world's attention with his theory, while Proudhon declined to name a movement after himself, and anarchism faded in and out of popularity over the next century. Marxism was mostly clearly used in the USSR, and the inevitable failing of their authoritarian system and the rise of capitalism in the western world after WWII seemed to be a resounding conclusion throughout the world: "capitalism might suck, but it's the best we got". I believe that anarchism is the only possible path for a successful society; capitalism begins to break its promises towards its workers, and every year we inch closer to technofeudalism. However, figures like Noam Chomsky and Kevin Carson have targeted and have the potential to fully revive the post-capitalist movement in libertarian views that should be obvious in American culture. I try to stay away from utopianism, but I genuinely believe that once we solve that fatal flaw of accumulation of wealth, "history will be over" as the free market's superiority for coordinating and rewarding labor will be demonstrated in the success of the most free, egalitarian, and rich society in the history of the world.

Emphasize the differences between the innovations of the free market and the parasitism of capitalism:
The free market gave us the smart phone. Capitalism gave us the $1000, locked-down, proprietary iPhone.  
The free market gave us insulin for $4. Capitalism gave us $200 insulin.  
The free market gave us cheap, high-quality printers. Capitalism gave us locked ink cartridges that cost more than human blood.  
The free market gave us farmers that could repair their tractors. Capitalism gave us proprietary software that requires a dealer to "authorize" a repair.  
The free market gave us free exchange of scientific knowledge. Capitalism gave us tax-payer funded research behind paywalls of $40 per article.  
The free market gave us internet. Capitalism gave us ISP monopolies.  
The free market gave us banking to store and lend money. Capitalism gave us overdraft fees, where the people with the least money are charged the most money specifically for having no money  
The free market gave us insurance, a way to have a safety net. Capitalism gave us the Parasitic Industry of health insurance, which leeches money from everyone and adds no economic value.
These are just some examples. Some are more impactful than others and there are so many more. I'm not even joking when I saw that almost everything good in the American's life comes from the free market, and almost everything bad in the American's life comes from capitalism. It sounds like too much of a generalization but I've spent a lot of time thinking about it and it's startingly consistent.
