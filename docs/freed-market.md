# What the Freed Market Means

The freed market is what happens when you remove the state's thumb from the scale and let people solve problems voluntarily. It's **radically pro-cooperation** and **anti-privilege** at the same time.

## Core Principles

- **Open entry:** No licenses or exclusive franchises that block willing neighbors from providing food, transport, childcare, or credit.
- **Mutual defense of consent:** Contracts and associations are voluntary; force and fraud are resisted by community standards and federated, accountable arbitration.
- **End to usury:** Profit is disciplined to the cost of real service. When capital is abundant and credit is mutualized, interest rates collapse toward maintenance fees.
- **Plural ownership:** Worker co-ops, peer production, neighborhood land trusts, and sole proprietors compete on value, not on captured regulation.
- **Social safety through networks, not bureaucracy:** Mutual aid societies, friendly societies, and micro-insurance pools replace paperwork-heavy welfare traps.

??? note "Why this is both 'left' and 'market'"
    - Left: It opposes hierarchy that extracts without consent; it aims for broad access to the means of living.
    - Market: It trusts voluntary exchange and experimentation more than command. It assumes people can coordinate without central planners when they share information freely.

## How Value Flows

In a freed market, every barrier you remove increases the supply of solutions:

1. **Remove patent walls →** open-source hardware, 3D printed parts, and local fabrication flourish.
2. **End land speculation →** community land trusts lower rent pressure and invite micro-housing and co-ops.
3. **Break banking monopolies →** mutual credit systems, peer-to-peer finance, and community currencies keep money circulating locally.
4. **Protect repair and sharing →** goods last longer, and subscription traps lose their grip.

> **Perfect competition isn't a slogan.** When anyone can enter, profit margins race downward until providers focus on care, quality, and reputation. The endgame is abundance — the voluntary communism that thinkers like Tucker and Chomsky both glimpsed from different angles.

## Culture Shift

The freed market isn't just policy; it's a cultural posture:

- Ask "who profits from the rule" before following it.
- Assume neighbors are capable collaborators, not liabilities.
- Measure success by resilience and dignity, not GDP alone.

This is not utopian wish-casting. It's an invitation to build systems where exploitation has nowhere to hide.
