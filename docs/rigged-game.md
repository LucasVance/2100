# The Rigged Game

**Capitalism, as practiced today, is a protection racket.** Monopoly profits come from privileges granted by the state, not from serving people better. Those privileges quietly tax your time, health, and creativity.

## How the Racket Shows Up

- **Artificial scarcity:** Patents extended beyond recovery of costs; copyright terms that outlive the inventors; occupational licenses that gatekeep entire industries.
- **Bailouts and guarantees:** Corporations pocket profits during booms and socialize losses during busts. Communities foot the bill every time.
- **Zoning and land games:** Housing kept scarce by code loopholes, parking minimums, and sweetheart deals. Rising rents behave like a private tax on neighborhood life.
- **Financial chokepoints:** Centralized banking favors big players while punishing small savers with fees and red tape. The unbanked pay the highest price to participate.
- **Disposable design:** Planned obsolescence and repair restrictions turn everyday items into subscription services.

??? note "Receipts: where the cost shows up"
    - Drug price spikes occur where patents and FDA exclusivity block generic competition.
    - Right-to-repair exemptions add weeks of downtime for farmers and hospitals.
    - Airline consolidation, backed by antitrust waivers after mergers, leads to fewer routes and higher fares.

## Why This Isn't a "Free Market"

A free market is a process, not a brand. It depends on permissionless entry, transparent information, and clear accountability. Our current system replaces those with paperwork, paywalls, and privilege.

> **Key distinction:** *Markets* are networks of voluntary exchange. *Capitalism* as we live it is a political arrangement that uses markets as a stage while keeping the script locked in the boardroom.

When market entry is genuinely open, predators cannot rest on monopoly profits. When the state builds tollbooths, the biggest players buy the tollbooths.

## The Human Cost

- Workers trade liberty for healthcare and retirement that could be portable.
- Communities lose small businesses that keep money circulating locally.
- Innovation slows because incumbents patent thickets and sue competitors instead of improving.

> **Bottom line:** The rigged game is not inevitable. It's a set of rules written by and for incumbents. We can rewrite them by refusing to grant the privileges in the first place.
