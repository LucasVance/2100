# Objections & Receipts

Common doubts deserve direct answers. Click to expand each objection.

??? question ""Markets always create inequality; why would this be different?""
    - Inequality explodes when entry is restricted and returns compound without competition. Removing privileges lowers margins and spreads ownership: co-ops, credit unions, and mutual credit distribute power by design.
    - Wealth locked behind intellectual property or exclusive charters is not market-derived; it's politically granted. Ending those grants dissolves a major driver of inequality.

??? question ""Who protects people from fraud or force?""
    - Community defense has always existed: friendly societies, arbitration networks, and restorative justice circles solve conflicts without bloated bureaucracies.
    - Federated insurance-like associations can require transparent audits and exclude bad actors, aligning incentives with protection instead of punishment quotas.

??? question ""Isn't this just deregulation that helps corporations?""
    - The current system deregulates risk while overregulating entry. Freed markets remove the privileges (subsidies, bailouts, patents) that corporations lobby for, while keeping consent and transparency non-negotiable.
    - Ending corporate personhood advantages and limited-liability shields for firms that cannot self-insure forces responsibility back onto decision-makers.

??? question ""How do we handle public goods like roads or broadband?""
    - Cooperatives already manage utilities, housing, and transit in many cities. Subscription roads, municipal co-ops, and neighborhood mesh networks show infrastructure can be mutualized.
    - Open standards let multiple providers interoperate; think community ISP peering or shared rights-of-way managed by federations instead of monopolies.

??? question ""What about people who are vulnerable or disabled?""
    - Mutual aid societies historically led in disability support, unemployment relief, and healthcare long before state programs. They scale horizontally through federations and reciprocal agreements.
    - When housing and medicine are not artificially scarce, support networks spend resources on care, not gatekeeping. Freed markets make inclusion cheaper because exclusion is expensive and unrewarding.

> **Steelman rule:** If you have another objection, send it. The freed market must survive contact with skeptics to matter.
