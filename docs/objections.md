If you made it through Parts 1–3, you’ve seen a pretty aggressive claim:

-   What we call “capitalism” is a state–corporate complex built on monopolies.
-   A genuinely free market would look very different from that.
-   Moving in that direction is desirable, even if it’s hard.

This page is for the big, recurring “yeah but what about…” worries:

-   human nature and chaos
-   public goods and safety
-   power and abuse
-   labels (“isn’t this just communism / anarcho-capitalism?”)
-   transition and realism
-   and, very specifically: **what happens to welfare?**

If your question isn’t here, there’s an “Ask your own question” section at the bottom.

## Human nature & chaos

??? question "Won't people just be selfish and screw each other over?"

    Short answer: they already do, under every system. The real question is *what
    structures reward it, contain it, or make it costly*.

    Capitalism doesn’t abolish selfishness; it channels it through state-backed
    monopolies and giant firms. State socialism doesn’t abolish selfishness either;
    it just concentrates power in a bureaucracy.

    Freed markets don’t assume people are saints. They assume:

    - people are a mix of selfish and cooperative,
    - people respond to incentives,
    - and people build norms and institutions to protect themselves.

    The point is to remove the giant, legally protected leverage points (the four
    monopolies, corporate shields, centralized states) that let *one* person’s
    selfishness scale into a global problem.

    You still get conflict and bad behavior. You also get:

    - more ability to walk away from bad deals,
    - more need to maintain a reputation,
    - and more experimentation with ways of cooperating that don’t rely on a distant
      hierarchy to punish everyone else.

??? question "Without a state, don't you just get warlords and mafia rule?"

    Warlords are what you get when you combine:

    - concentrated violence,
    - concentrated wealth,
    - and communities that can't exit or defend themselves.

    Modern states and corporations already tick a lot of those boxes. They’re just
    larger, better branded warlords with official letterhead.

    A freed-market, anarchistic society pushes in the opposite direction:

    - **Decentralized power**: no single institution has a legal monopoly on violence.
    - **Exit options**: it's easier to leave abusive setups and join or form others.
    - **Polycentric defense**: overlapping community defense, mutual aid, insurance,
      and conflict-resolution systems instead of “one army, one police force, one boss”.

    Could local bullies still try to take over? Of course. But it's *harder* to run a
    mini-state when:

    - you can't lean on national law and police,
    - people have more economic independence,
    - and neighboring communities aren't locked into obeying the same center.

??? question "If everyone can just say no, doesn't everything fall apart?"

    “Everything” already *does* fall apart, just more slowly and more politely:

    - climate, infrastructure, public health, basic trust.

    The assumption behind this question is that:

    > order only exists because there’s a central authority forcing people to cooperate.

    In reality, almost all the order in your life comes from:

    - norms,
    - mutual expectations,
    - contracts,
    - and decentralized systems (markets, families, professional networks, open-source
      communities, etc.).

    The argument here is: if you remove the rigged monopolies and central choke points,
    that bottom-up order *has more room*, not less.

## Public goods & safety

??? question "Who keeps buildings from falling down without state building codes?"

    Today, building safety comes from a mix of:

    - engineering knowledge and professional standards,
    - building codes and inspectors,
    - insurance companies refusing to cover bad designs,
    - and people suing when things go wrong.

    Only some of that is state-run.

    In a freed-market, anarchistic setting, you’d still have:

    - engineering associations publishing standards,
    - insurers refusing to cover unsafe construction,
    - rating and certification organizations,
    - and communities that simply won't hire builders with a bad safety record.

    The difference is:

    - there’s no single monopoly code-writing authority,
    - and no state shielding big developers from consequences because they’re “too
      important”.

    You don’t get *zero* risk. You get a world where “we’ll build it cheap and pray”
    is harder to sustain when insurance, reputation, and peer review all punish that.

??? question "What about really dangerous stuff, like nuclear plants?"

    High-risk tech needs high standards, regardless of ideology.

    In a freed-market order, you’d expect:

    - very few actors willing to take on extreme, long-duration risks if they are
      *personally* exposed to liability,
    - insurers that are obsessive about safety, because one incident can wipe them out,
    - specialized technical associations whose entire job is to vet designs and
      practices.

    If a community *really* wants a nuclear plant, they have to:

    - persuade insurers, engineers, and neighbors that the design is sound,
    - internalize the costs and risks instead of dumping them on everyone else via
      national policy.

    That’s not a detailed blueprint. But it’s enough to see that “no state monopoly”
    doesn’t equal “no standards”.

??? question "Who builds and maintains roads, infrastructure, and utilities?"

    Even today, a lot of this work is already:

    - contracted out,
    - operated by private or quasi-private entities,
    - or heavily funded and maintained at local levels.

    In a freed-market setup, you’d see a mix of:

    - **Cooperative / community ownership** of local infrastructure,
    - **User-funded associations** (like road or utility co-ops),
    - **Federated agreements** between regions that share networks.

    The key shift is: users and local communities have more direct control and more
    alternatives, instead of one distant bureaucracy making all decisions for them.

??? question "What about pandemics and big, coordinated public health problems?"

    Large-scale risks need large-scale coordination. Removing a state monopoly on
    coordination doesn’t remove the need; it changes *how* it happens.

    Likely ingredients in a freed market:

    - independent epidemiology and research networks (already a thing),
    - federated health associations that can issue recommendations and standards,
    - mutual-aid and insurance arrangements that create incentives to follow those
      standards,
    - contractual expectations: venues, carriers, and communities can require certain
      precautions as a condition of interaction.

    Will everyone cooperate perfectly? No. They don’t now either.
    The question is whether information can move faster, and whether decisions are made
    closer to the people actually affected, instead of filtered through political
    theater.

## Power, abuse & vulnerability

??? question "What about people who can't 'just start a co-op' — disabled people, children, elders?"

    Any serious vision has to have an answer for people who:

    - can’t be “independent” in the narrow, heroic sense,
    - need sustained support,
    - or are subject to guardianship (kids, people with certain disabilities, etc.).

    Two honest points:

    - No system fixes vulnerability. There will always be people who need care.
    - Centralized systems are often *terrible* at caring for them, even when they claim
      the opposite.

    In a freed-market / anarchist direction, the answers are messy and plural:

    - Dense **mutual aid networks** instead of top-down welfare bureaucracies.
    - **Community and family structures** that have more time and resources because
      less of everyone’s life is eaten by rent, debt, and precarity.
    - **Specialized care co-ops** and associations where people pool resources and labor
      to support those who need it.

    None of this is automatic. It’s an area where culture, ethics, and deliberate
    institution-building matter a lot. But it’s not obvious that “let a distant
    bureaucracy sort it out” is the high bar to beat.

??? question "What if my local community is oppressive or abusive — isn't that worse without a state above it?"

    Local communities *can* be awful: racist, sexist, homophobic, cultish. Anarchists
    have always known this.

    The question is: when your town or subculture sucks, what tools do you have?

    In a centralized system, often:

    - local elites + state power = very hard to challenge,
    - moving away is economically expensive and legally complex,
    - the bigger state often sides with local power if it’s convenient.

    In a more decentralized, freed-market setup, you want:

    - **More exit options**: easier to move, easier to find other communities and
      institutions that will take you in.
    - **Competing jurisdictions / associations**: if one “justice system” is captured
      by abusers, others can arise.
    - **Networks of solidarity** that can intervene across local boundaries.

    There’s no guarantee. But concentrating power at the top doesn’t magically make
    your town good; it just adds another layer of power that can go wrong.

## Labels & ideologies

??? question "Isn't this just communism with extra steps?"

    Definitions here are messy, but:

    - **State communism / Marxist-Leninism**:
      - central party and state control most major production,
      - markets are heavily suppressed or abolished,
      - planning is political.

    What I’m describing:

    - keeps **markets** and voluntary exchange,
    - pushes ownership and control toward **workers, users, and communities**,
    - removes legal privileges that let passive owners and bureaucrats rule from above.

    That’s a tradition often called:

    - libertarian socialism,
    - anarchism (especially mutualism / left-market anarchism),
    - or “freed-market anti-capitalism”.

    So: it shares communism’s critique of exploitation, but rejects the idea that a
    centralized state is the way out.

??? question "Isn't this just anarcho-capitalism?"

    Super important distinction.

    Most versions of anarcho-capitalism:

    - accept existing property titles and big fortunes as basically legitimate,
    - treat any challenge to those titles as aggression,
    - and imagine a stateless world where those owners simply hire private security
      instead of using police.

    What I’m arguing for:

    - directly questions the **legitimacy** of much existing property, especially
      land, monopolies, and fortunes built on the four monopolies,
    - focuses on **dismantling those monopolies** and privileges first,
    - expects firms to be **smaller, flatter, more worker-run** on average.

    In short: this is not “let Amazon write the laws instead of Congress.”
    It’s “make it hard for anything like Amazon-as-we-know-it to exist.”

??? question "Isn't this just 'better regulated capitalism'?"

    Regulating capitalism assumes:

    - the basic structure (wage labor, landlordism, monopoly-friendly IP, giant firms)
      is legitimate,
    - the state is mostly a neutral referee,
    - our job is to tweak the rules around the edges.

    The freed-market anarchist view here is:

    - the basic structure is *not* neutral: it’s built on enclosure, monopolies, and
      upward redistribution baked into law,
    - some regulations genuinely protect people, others entrench monopolies,
    - the goal is to **replace** the underlying structure over time, not just patch it.

    That doesn’t mean “no reforms ever.” It means we care about *which direction*
    they push.

## Transition & realism

??? question "How do we get from here to there without a magic revolution?"

    Honestly: there is no script.

    You can think of change happening on three overlapping layers:

    - **Story** – how people explain their own lives: is capitalism “the end of history”
      or just one rigged system among others? Changing this is slow but foundational.
    - **Counter-institutions** – co-ops, mutual aid, community finance, free knowledge
      projects, etc. They don’t abolish capitalism, but they carve out zones where its
      rules bite less.
    - **Harm-reduction fights** – reforms that reduce suffering and buy time, without
      confusing them for liberation.

    There’s no “Stage 1: do X, Stage 2: utopia.” There’s just:

    - more people seeing the machine clearly,
    - more people building alternatives where they can,
    - more people refusing apathy when small wins are on the table.

??? question "What can I actually do that isn’t just vibes?"

    Depends on your situation, skills, and risk tolerance.

    Some directions that fit this worldview:

    - **Lowest lift**
      - Talk to someone you trust about the difference between markets and capitalism.
      - Share one example that made something click for you (phones, insulin, printers,
        right-to-repair, etc.).
    - **Medium lift**
      - Join something local that pushes against one of the four monopolies:
        a co-op, credit union, tenant union, repair collective, open-source project.
      - Support harm-reduction campaigns where you live: right-to-repair, zoning
        reform, tenant protections, etc.
    - **Higher lift**
      - Help start or strengthen a counter-institution: co-op, mutual aid network,
        community land project, free-knowledge initiative.
      - Create your own explanations (videos, zines, talks, tools) that translate
        these ideas into your community’s language.

    None of that guarantees “victory.” But it changes what you’re cooperating with,
    and that’s not nothing.

## What happens to welfare? (The Tucker–Chomsky synthesis)

??? question "If you want to shrink the state, what happens to welfare, public services, and protections?"

    This is the place where a lot of anarchist / libertarian talk turns ugly fast, so
    I want to be very clear.

    There are **two very different** ways to “shrink the state”:

    1. **Smash the floor, leave the ceiling.**
       - Cut welfare, public services, and basic protections.
       - Leave banking cartels, landlordism, IP monopolies, corporate welfare, and
         bailouts mostly intact.
       - Call the resulting cruelty “freedom”.

    2. **Strike down the ceiling and expand the floor.**
       - Attack the legal privileges that let wealth and power concentrate (the four
         monopolies, subsidies, bailouts, “too-big-to-fail” protections).
       - At the same time, expand people’s *real* security through co-ops, mutual aid,
         community care, free knowledge, etc.
       - Only talk about rolling back state welfare *after* people are no longer
         structurally dependent on it to survive.

    The first is the usual neoliberal playbook.
    The second is closer to a **Tucker–Chomsky** synthesis:

    - **Benjamin Tucker**: focus on smashing monopolies and unearned privilege – the
      *ceiling*.
    - **Noam Chomsky** (when he talks about policy): defend and improve welfare and
      basic protections for ordinary people while concentrated power still exists –
      the *floor*.

    From this perspective:

    - “Deregulation” that makes it easier to pollute, bust unions, or shred the safety
      net while banks and landlords stay privileged is **not** a step toward freed
      markets.
    - The early targets should be:
      - corporate welfare and subsidies,
      - bailouts and special protections,
      - IP overreach and repair restrictions,
      - barriers that lock co-ops, small producers, and mutual finance out of markets.
    - Meanwhile, social supports (welfare, public healthcare/education, etc.) are
      seen as **messy but necessary crutches** in a world where people have already
      been dispossessed.

    In a long-run freed-market vision:

    - As land monopoly, banking privilege, and IP cages disappear,
    - as co-ops, mutual aid, and community institutions actually work,
    - the need for centralized welfare genuinely shrinks.

    At *that* point, “withering away” the state’s safety net can mean:

    - handing functions to institutions controlled by the people who use them,
    - rather than just dropping people into a rigged “free market” and telling them
      to swim.

    Pulling the welfare floor out first, while the monopoly ceiling is still in place,
    is not anarchism. It’s just a more honest name for austerity.

## Ask your own question

No FAQ can anticipate every “yeah but what about…” that a curious or skeptical person
will have.

I set up a separate Q&A bot (using Gemini) that’s tuned to this project:

-   It knows the content of these pages.
-   It’s nudged to explain things in plain language.
-   It’s there so you can ask very specific questions I didn’t think to cover.

👉 **Ask your question here:**  
_(Replace this with your actual embed or link.)_

For example, you could ask:

-   “What happens if someone wants to build a nuclear plant in this system?”
-   “How would structural engineering firms work without government inspectors?”
-   “What about climate change and global coordination?”
-   “What if a co-op turns into a new hierarchy — what checks exist then?”

Use it as a conversation partner. And if it surfaces a question or objection this
page really should cover, that’s feedback I’d love to hear.
