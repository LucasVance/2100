# Beyond the False Choice

We're sold a binary: either accept corporate capitalism or embrace top-down statism. Both keep power concentrated and accountability distant.

## Why the Binary Fails

- **Corporate capture:** Deregulation in name only, followed by subsidies, intellectual property overreach, and regulatory arbitrage that block newcomers.
- **Command-and-control socialism:** Attempts to plan production centrally, often recreating hierarchy with bureaucrats instead of CEOs.
- **Result:** Everyday people still lack control, and the environment still absorbs the bill.

??? note "History in brief"
    - Gilded Age monopolies relied on state-granted charters, rail land grants, and tariffs.
    - 20th-century state socialism delivered industrial catch-up but stifled dissent and innovation.
    - 21st-century corporate welfare packages trade tax revenue for short-term jobs that leave when subsidies expire.

## The Third Path

Left-wing market anarchism argues we can keep voluntary exchange while dissolving coercive privilege:

1. **Cut off the privilege pipelines** — patents, subsidies, exclusive franchises, bailouts, and regulatory barriers that favor size over service.
2. **Maximize federation, minimize hierarchy** — networks of cooperatives, credit unions, and community utilities linked by open standards rather than corporate backrooms.
3. **Localize accountability** — decisions made where consequences land, with exit options and competition keeping leaders honest.

> We don't want a new boss. We want to retire the position.

## How It Feels on the Ground

- City governments stop criminalizing street vendors; food quality is policed by reputation and transparent kitchens instead of paperwork monopolies.
- Broadband is delivered by neighborhood mesh networks instead of hostage ISPs.
- Energy cooperatives invest in community solar and microgrids rather than pleading with centralized utilities.
- Neighborhood justice circles and federated arbitration handle conflicts faster and more fairly than overloaded courts.

The freed market isn't a middle compromise — it's a rejection of coercive privilege altogether.
