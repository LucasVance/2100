# The Roadmap

The freed market is not a someday dream. It grows every time people bypass gatekeepers and build directly with each other. Start where you are.

## Individual Actions (this week)

- **Practice exit:** Switch one recurring purchase to a local provider, co-op, or mutual aid network.
- **De-monopolize your tools:** Use open-source software and repair-friendly hardware; support right-to-repair campaigns.
- **Mutualize your money:** Join a credit union; participate in community lending circles or time banks.
- **Signal your standards:** Favor businesses that publish transparent pricing, labor policies, and repair guides.

## Community Builds (this season)

1. **Neighborhood resilience hubs** — shared spaces with tool libraries, battery backups, community fridges, and gardens.
2. **Mesh networks and community broadband** — open Wi‑Fi and fiber co-ops that keep data local and affordable.
3. **Producer and consumer co-ops** — grocery co-ops, ride-share collectives, childcare and eldercare co-ops.
4. **Mutual credit & local currencies** — keep value circulating; reduce reliance on big-bank chokepoints.

??? note "Dual-power mindset"
    - Build alternatives *alongside* existing institutions so people have options before crises hit.
    - Use redundancy: co-ops plus mutual aid plus local governance provide overlapping safety nets.

## Policy Demands (short list)

While the endgame is post-privilege, there are immediate fights worth winning because they open space for cooperation:

- End corporate welfare and bailouts; make firms fail like everyone else.
- Abolish exclusive franchises and protectionist licensing that block entry.
- Enforce right-to-repair and interoperability; ban DRM that criminalizes tinkering.
- Phase out intellectual property monopolies; shorten terms and expand fair use while transitioning to prize and patronage models.
- Legalize home-based microenterprise and street vending.

## Metrics That Matter

- **Resilience:** How quickly can neighbors restore power, food, and medical care without waiting on distant corporations?
- **Participation:** How many residents are owners, not just customers or workers?
- **Circulation:** What percentage of spending stays within the community for multiple turns?
- **Liberation:** Do people have real exit options from abusive bosses, landlords, and bureaucracies?

> The destination is abundance without permission slips. Every co-op launched, every mutual aid project funded, every repair manual shared is a step on the map.
