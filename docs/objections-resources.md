If you made it this far, you probably have a lot of questions. That is good. The ideas here—that capitalism is a state-corporate monopoly system and that a genuinely free market would be radically different—are dense and often counter-intuitive because they challenge deep-seated assumptions.

I am also steeped in these assumptions, and it was total serendipity that I stumbled across these ideas. Because I am still discovering these details myself, I want to heavily push you towards resources much more knowledgeable than me. I am confident that almost everyone who seriously engages with these ideas with meaningful intellectual curiosity will be forced to reevaluate their worldview to a large extent.

### 1. Chat with the 2100 Gem
I have created a custom trained Gemini instance specifically to answer questions about this philosophy, objections, and details. It is extremely capable of providing detailed, individualized responses to whatever situations you want to explore, such as "what happens to building codes?", "what happens when somebody builds a nuclear plant?", or "who builds the roads?".

### 2. Read *Markets Not Capitalism*
If you read one book, make it this one. It is a collection of essays that lays out the entire thesis of "freed-market anti-capitalism" far better than I can. The anarchist authors despise copyright/IP, so it is available as a free [PDF](https://marketsnotcapitalism.com/pdf) or [audiobook](https://archive.org/details/MarketsNotCapitalismAudiobook).
