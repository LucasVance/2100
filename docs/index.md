## The Game is Rigged

Capitalism is not a synonym for "commerce." It is a specific system of state interference that funnels wealth upward. We are paying a "Parasite Tax" on every hour we work.

??? quote "Example objection"
    **The Objection:**

    **The Reality:**

Our tax dollars are funneled into the hands of the owning class, while millions of Americans starve. The military-industrial complex secures corporate interests abroad, not your freedom at home.

## Capitalism is not a free market

"You wouldn't have the iPhone if not for capitalism!" 

**Incorrect.** Capitalism didn't give you the iPhone; the free market did. Capitalism gave you the overpriced, restricted, un-repairable version of the iPhone.

### The Four Monopolies
Benjamin Tucker identified four major ways the State protects the rich from having to compete with you.

1. **Patents:** The idea monopoly.
2. **Tariffs:** The protection racket.
3. **Land:** Absentee ownership.
4. **Money:** The banking cartel.

??? check "Quiz: Are you a Capitalist or a Free Marketeer?"
    **Scenario:** A big pharmaceutical company invents a life-saving drug. A small lab figures out how to make it cheaper. The Big Company sues the small lab to stop them. Who do you support?
    
    * **Support the Big Company?** → You are a **Capitalist** (You support State Monopolies).
    * **Support the Small Lab?** → You are a **Free Marketeer** (You support Competition).

## Comfort fears about socialism

This section might be combined with "Capitalism is not a free market" as a footnote that assures readers that a Marxist-Leninist style violent revolution is not necessary and that State Socialism is not the goal

## Part 4: The Solution – "The Ecosystem of Freedom"

We propose **Anarchism Without Adjectives**. We use the right tool for the job.

* **Markets** for scarce goods (shoes, gadgets).
* **The Commons** for abundant goods (software, water, ideas).

??? abstract "The Paradox: How Competition Creates Communism"
    If you truly deregulate (abolish patents, banking monopolies), competition becomes so fierce that profit margins fall to zero. When the cost of goods hits zero, market exchange becomes obsolete, and you naturally shift to a "take what you need" system.

## Part 5: The Roadmap – "How We Get There"

We don't wait for the collapse. We build the new world in the shell of the old.
