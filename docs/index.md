# 2100: Restoring the American Dream

Most of us were taught a simple picture of how society works:

-   The State exists to keep the Corporation in check.
-   the Corporation innovate and create wealth, while the State regulates excess.
-   Our “ideal system” is a balance between the two.

If that story were true, you wouldn’t be working harder than ever while getting priced out of housing, healthcare, education, and stability.

This project starts from a different claim:

> What we call “capitalism” in America is not a free market at all.
> It’s a State–Corporate complex held together by a small set of legal privileges.
> Remove those privileges, and markets stop propping up capitalists and start empowering workers.

This site is an attempt to make that worldview legible without requiring months of reading obscure theory.

## What this project is

This site is:

-   An explanation of how the State and the Corporation actually work together\*\*, instead of acting as natural enemies.
-   A walkthrough of Benjamin Tucker’s four monopolies (money, land, tariffs, and patents) as the core mechanisms that keep the system tilted.
-   A sketch of what a freed market (a market without the State-backed monopolies) would tend to look like.

This site is not:

-   A complete historical treatise on every failure of capitalism.
-   A step-by-step roadmap for revolution, policy reform, or how to get from here to there.
-   A new political party, ideological brand, or cult.

I’m not pretending to know the perfect transition plan. My goal is more modest:

> If you understand why the State–Corporation complex depends on those four monopolies,
> you can see why a left-wing, market-based, anti-capitalism is a logical outcome, not a contradiction.

## How to read this site

Different people need different amounts of proof, so the site is structured like an accordion: you can skim, or you can pull for depth.

In practice:

-   Each page starts with short, plain-language claims.
-   Below that, you’ll find longer explanations if you want more detail.
-   In some places there are or will be “deep dive” sections that dig into history, economics, or data for people who want to stress-test the ideas.

You don’t have to read everything in order. But if you like a linear path, the modules are arranged to walk you from “something is off” to “oh, this is what a genuinely freed market would imply.”

## The argument in three parts

### Part 1: The State vs. the Corporation

We start with the official narrative:

-   Government and business are in tension.
-   Elections and regulations keep the Corporation in check.
-   The Corporation pushes back against “big government.”

Then we compare that story to what actually happens:

-   Bailouts for banks and large firms when they fail.
-   Regulations that entrench incumbents and freeze out new competitors.
-   Intellectual property and licensing laws enforced by courts and police that give the Corporation legal monopolies.
-   Public money funding the research, infrastructure, and protection that private firms later monetize.

By the end of this part, the goal is simple:

> Instead of seeing the State and big business as rivals in balance,
> you see them as partners in a shared business model.

The name for that model doesn’t really matter; “State capitalism,” “Corporatism,” or “State–Corporate complex” all point at the same pattern.

### Part 2: Capitalism is not a free market

Once you see the alliance, the next question is: what holds it together? Why doesn’t it just dissolve under competition?

Here we use an old but useful lens: Benjamin Tucker’s four monopolies—

1. Money / Credit – Who is allowed to issue credit, on what terms, under what regulations?
2. Land – How ownership is defined, enforced, and restricted (titles, zoning, landlordism).
3. Tariffs / Trade Controls – The rules that decide who can sell what across borders, and at what cost.
4. Patents / Intellectual Property – Legal monopolies on ideas, designs, and formulas.

For each one, we look at three questions:

-   What does the law actually do?
-   How does that law tilt the playing field toward large, capital-rich institutions and away from ordinary people?
-   How does it show up in your life? (rent, prices, debt, wages, lock-in to giant platforms, etc.)

The claim here is not “greed exists” — that’s trivial. The claim is:

> Without these State-backed monopolies,
> it would be very hard for today’s kind of capitalism to survive.

The State doesn’t just “regulate” markets; it manufactures and protects the conditions under which large concentrations of capital can extract persistent rents.

### Part 3: The freed market

If you remove or radically weaken those monopolies, what then?

This part doesn’t present a utopian blueprint. It offers tendencies, not a detailed constitution:

-   When credit is open and not cartelized, it’s easier for workers and small groups to own tools and start enterprises, and harder for a small class of investors to dominate everything.
-   When land titles and use are not tilted toward absentee ownership and speculation, housing and workspace behave less like scarce casino chips and more like infrastructure people can actually live and work in.
-   When trade and IP don’t lock in incumbents, prices track costs more closely, and it’s harder to sustain gigantic markups just by lawyering competitors out of existence.

Put differently:

> The freer the market actually is,
> the harder it is to sustain today’s version of capitalism.

You don’t have to agree with every step. But if you grant the basic logic, you can see a rough shape emerge: markets that are more decentralized, more worker-controlled, and less friendly to passive owners of capital.

That’s the “direction of travel” this project is trying to clarify.

## Where this site stops (and where to go next)

There’s a natural temptation to ask:

-   “Okay, but what exactly should we do tomorrow?”
-   “Which reforms, which strategies, which technologies?”
-   “What about X country, Y historical failure, Z current crisis?”

Those questions matter, but this project doesn’t pretend to solve them all. My scope ends roughly here:

-   Show that the State–Corporate balance story is false.
-   Show how a small set of legal monopolies keep the current system alive.
-   Show why a freed market points toward a left-wing, anti-capitalist outcome, not just “capitalism with fewer rules.”

From there, the best I can do is point you toward people who’ve spent decades thinking about tactics, history, and detailed models:

-   Center for a Stateless Society (C4SS) – day-to-day analysis and commentary from a left-market perspective.
-   _Markets Not Capitalism_ – essays exploring this whole “free market anti-capitalism” idea in much more depth.
-   Work on commons governance, co-ops, and mutual aid – real-world experiments in non-State, non-Corporate forms of coordination.

Think of this site as onboarding: a translation layer between “something is wrong with capitalism” and the much denser body of work that already exists.
