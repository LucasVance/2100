# So what's the alternative?
When confronted with the problems of Capitalism, the most common thing is to turn towards more State control of Corporation. This is because we have a false idea of how our economy works: we're told that the State vs the Corporation is a balancing act, one of more is less of the other. Capitalism is presented as balancing the Corporation more than the State, and Socialism is presented as balancing the State over the Corporation. When we encounter the abuses of the Corporation, we are told that we must run to the State to protect us.
The truth is, the State and the Corporation need each other to survive. The Corporation needs privilege from the State to protect it from having to compete in a free market, and the State needs the fear of "unregulated Corporation" to justify its authority.
The truth is, the Corporation cannot survive in a free market.

# Capitalism is not a free market

Even in 1888, an American individualist by the name of Benjamin Tucker identified four monopolies that the State enforces to protect the Corporation from a free market: land, money, patents, and tariffs.

Today, the State...

The free market gave us the smart phone. Capitalism gave us the $1000, locked-down, proprietary iPhone.
The free market gave us insulin for $4. Capitalism gave us $200 insulin.
The free market gave us cheap, high-quality printers. Capitalism gave us locked ink cartridges that cost more than human blood.
The free market gave us farmers that could repair their tractors. Capitalism gave us proprietary software that requires a dealer to "authorize" a repair.
The free market gave us abundant water. Capitalism gave us plastic water bottles pumped from public streams, marked up at 2,000% profit.
The free market gave us free exchange of scientific knowledge. Capitalism gave us tax-payer funded research behind paywalls of $40 per article.
The free market gave us internet. Capitalism gave us ISP monopolies.
The free market gave us banking to store and lend money. Capitalism gave us overdraft fees, where the people with the least money are charged the most money specifically for having no money

Employees have to compete for jobs, but employers don't have to compete for laborers because

### The Four Monopolies
Benjamin Tucker identified four major ways the State protects the rich from having to compete with you.

1. **Patents:** The idea monopoly.
2. **Tariffs:** The protection racket.
3. **Land:** Absentee ownership.
4. **Money:** The banking cartel.

??? check "Quiz: Are you a Capitalist or a Free Marketeer?"
    **Scenario:** A big pharmaceutical company invents a life-saving drug. A small lab figures out how to make it cheaper. The Big Company sues the small lab to stop them. Who do you support?
    
    * **Support the Big Company?** → You are a **Capitalist** (You support State Monopolies).
    * **Support the Small Lab?** → You are a **Free Marketeer** (You support Competition).

## Comfort fears about socialism

This section might be combined with "Capitalism is not a free market" as a footnote that assures readers that a Marxist-Leninist style violent revolution is not necessary and that State Socialism is not the goal

## Part 4: The Solution – "The Ecosystem of Freedom"

We propose **Anarchism Without Adjectives**. We use the right tool for the job.

* **Markets** for scarce goods (shoes, gadgets).
* **The Commons** for abundant goods (software, water, ideas).

??? abstract "The Paradox: How Competition Creates Communism"
    If you truly deregulate (abolish patents, banking monopolies), competition becomes so fierce that profit margins fall to zero. When the cost of goods hits zero, market exchange becomes obsolete, and you naturally shift to a "take what you need" system.

We don't wait for the collapse. We build the new world in the shell of the old.
