# Welcome to the Freed Market Playbook

> A practical guide to building a society that treats people like neighbors, not inputs on a spreadsheet.

We wrote this project for friends and family who feel the system grinding them down but don't want another lecture about ideology. The freed market — also called left-wing market anarchism — is the idea that when you strip away state-granted privilege, communities get the breathing room to solve problems together. Think of it as the missing option between corporate capture and bureaucratic command.

This site uses the **accordion model**: every section can be skimmed in a minute or unfolded for depth. Use the details blocks to "open the case file" when you want receipts.

## The Big Picture

- **The Problem:** Corporate capitalism feeds on state favors, insulating monopolies from real competition while shifting risk onto workers and communities.
- **The Opportunity:** Free people cooperating in truly open markets already build food networks, credit unions, mutual aid, and worker co-ops that outcompete extractive giants when the playing field is level.
- **The Mission:** Replace privilege with permissionless cooperation, so prosperity comes from meeting needs instead of collecting rents.
