# Our system is flawed

## You are being physically poisoned.

You have plastic in your brain, toxic chemicals in your blood.
  
Our beautiful land is being irreversibly damaged.
  
One of the most profitable advances of the tech Industry was figuring out how to hack your brain.
  
Friends and family are more divided than ever through Manufactured culture disagremeents.
  
## You are being economically drained.
  
You are vastly more economically productive than your grandparents, yet you own significantly less.
  
Parasitic Industries steal most of the product of your labor.
  
Things you buy are designed to prematurely fail in order to keep you buying.
  
Basic necessities like food, housing, and medicine are artificially expensive and bad.
  
## You have no voice.
  
"Your tax dollars go to bombing civilians and children in third-world countries in order to secure Corporate interests.

The Corporate News Networks are propaganda to keep you in submission to the will of the State and the Corporation.
  
Politicians are easily bought out by anyone that has the money to do it.
  
Despite living in a "democracy," nobody's vote truly matters.

Despite living in a "democracy," you throw away your Bill of Rights every time you go to work.

# So what's the alternative?
When confronted with the problems of Capitalism, the most common thing is to turn towards more State control of Corporation. This is because we have a false idea of how our economy works: we're told that the State vs the Corporation is a balancing act, one of more is less of the other. Capitalism is presented as balancing the Corporation more than the State, and Socialism is presented as balancing the State over the Corporation. When we encounter the abuses of the Corporation, we are told that we must run to the State to protect us.
The truth is, the State and the Corporation need each other to survive. The Corporation needs privilege from the State to protect it from having to compete in a free market, and the State needs the fear of "unregulated Corporation" to justify its authority.
The truth is, the Corporation cannot survive in a free market.

# Capitalism is not a free market

The free market gave us the smart phone. Capitalism gave us the $1000, locked-down, proprietary iPhone.  
The free market gave us insulin for $4. Capitalism gave us $200 insulin.  
The free market gave us cheap, high-quality printers. Capitalism gave us locked ink cartridges that cost more than human blood.  
The free market gave us farmers that could repair their tractors. Capitalism gave us proprietary software that requires a dealer to "authorize" a repair.  
The free market gave us free exchange of scientific knowledge. Capitalism gave us tax-payer funded research behind paywalls of $40 per article.  
The free market gave us internet. Capitalism gave us ISP monopolies.  
The free market gave us banking to store and lend money. Capitalism gave us overdraft fees, where the people with the least money are charged the most money specifically for having no money  
The free market gave us insurance, a way to have a safety net. Capitalism gave us the Parasitic Industry of health insurance, which leeches money from everyone and adds no economic value.

Employees have to compete for jobs, but employers don't have to compete for laborers because...
