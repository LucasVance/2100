# The game is rigged

1. You are being physically poisoned.
  
  You have plastic in your brain, toxic chemicals in your blood.
  
  Our beautiful land is being irreversibly damaged.
  
  One of the most profitable advances of the tech Industry was figuring out how to hack your brain.
  
  Friends and family are more divided than ever through Manufactured culture disagremeents.
  
2. You are being economically drained.
  
  You are vastly more economically productive than your grandparents, yet you own significantly less.
  
  Parasitic Industries steal most of the product of your labor.
  
  Things you buy are designed to prematurely fail in order to keep you buying.
  
  Basic necessities like food, housing, and medicine are artificially expensive and bad.
  
3. You have no voice.

      ??? info "Yeah, but we do it for freedom and defense."
  
  The Corporate News Networks are propaganda to keep you in submission to the will of the State and the Corporation.
  
  Politicians are easily bought out by anyone that has the money to do it.
  
  Despite living in a "democracy," nobody's vote truly matters.
  
  Despite living in a "democracy," you throw away your Bill of Rights every time you go to work.
  

How did this happen?

## Capitalism is not a free market

"You wouldn't have the iPhone if not for capitalism!" 

**Incorrect.** Capitalism didn't give you the iPhone; the free market did. Capitalism gave you the overpriced, restricted, un-repairable version of the iPhone.

### The Four Monopolies
Benjamin Tucker identified four major ways the State protects the rich from having to compete with you.

1. **Patents:** The idea monopoly.
2. **Tariffs:** The protection racket.
3. **Land:** Absentee ownership.
4. **Money:** The banking cartel.

??? check "Quiz: Are you a Capitalist or a Free Marketeer?"
    **Scenario:** A big pharmaceutical company invents a life-saving drug. A small lab figures out how to make it cheaper. The Big Company sues the small lab to stop them. Who do you support?
    
    * **Support the Big Company?** → You are a **Capitalist** (You support State Monopolies).
    * **Support the Small Lab?** → You are a **Free Marketeer** (You support Competition).

## Part 4: The Solution – "The Ecosystem of Freedom"

We propose **Anarchism Without Adjectives**. We use the right tool for the job.

* **Markets** for scarce goods (shoes, gadgets).
* **The Commons** for abundant goods (software, water, ideas).

??? abstract "The Paradox: How Competition Creates Communism"
    If you truly deregulate (abolish patents, banking monopolies), competition becomes so fierce that profit margins fall to zero. When the cost of goods hits zero, market exchange becomes obsolete, and you naturally shift to a "take what you need" system.

## Part 5: The Roadmap – "How We Get There"

We don't wait for the collapse. We build the new world in the shell of the old.
