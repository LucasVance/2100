> **Mission:** To dismantle the narrative that equates "Capitalism" with "Free Markets," and to demonstrate that the path to true liberty lies in dismantling state-enforced corporate privileges for a truly freed market.

## Part 1: The Diagnosis – "The Game is Rigged"

Capitalism is not a synonym for "commerce." It is a specific system of state interference that funnels wealth upward. We are paying a "Parasite Tax" on every hour we work.

??? quote "Yeah, but isn't this just how the world works?"
    **The Objection:** "Hierarchy is natural. There have always been rich and poor people. You can't fight human nature."

    **The Reality:** Humans are adaptable. If you put people in a system that rewards greed (Capitalism), they act greedy. If you put them in a system that rewards cooperation, they cooperate. The current hierarchy isn't "natural"; it is enforced by police, patents, and bailouts.

### The War Machine
Our tax dollars are funneled into the hands of the owning class, while millions of Americans starve. The military-industrial complex secures corporate interests abroad, not your freedom at home.

## Part 2: The Definition – "We Don't Have a Free Market"

"You wouldn't have the iPhone if not for capitalism!" 

**Incorrect.** Capitalism didn't give you the iPhone; the free market did. Capitalism gave you the overpriced, restricted, un-repairable version of the iPhone.

### The Four Monopolies
Benjamin Tucker identified four major ways the State protects the rich from having to compete with you.

1. **Patents:** The idea monopoly.
2. **Tariffs:** The protection racket.
3. **Land:** Absentee ownership.
4. **Money:** The banking cartel.

??? check "Quiz: Are you a Capitalist or a Free Marketeer?"
    **Scenario:** A big pharmaceutical company invents a life-saving drug. A small lab figures out how to make it cheaper. The Big Company sues the small lab to stop them. Who do you support?
    
    * **Support the Big Company?** → You are a **Capitalist** (You support State Monopolies).
    * **Support the Small Lab?** → You are a **Free Marketeer** (You support Competition).

## Part 3: The False Choice – "Why We Don't Want a New Boss"

We don't have to do a Marxist-Leninist style violent revolution. Replacing a CEO with a Bureaucrat is not freedom.

### State Socialism vs. Libertarian Socialism
* **State Socialism:** The Government owns the factory.
* **Libertarian Socialism:** The Workers own the factory.

---

## Part 4: The Solution – "The Ecosystem of Freedom"

We propose **Anarchism Without Adjectives**. We use the right tool for the job.

* **Markets** for scarce goods (shoes, gadgets).
* **The Commons** for abundant goods (software, water, ideas).

??? abstract "The Paradox: How Competition Creates Communism"
    If you truly deregulate (abolish patents, banking monopolies), competition becomes so fierce that profit margins fall to zero. When the cost of goods hits zero, market exchange becomes obsolete, and you naturally shift to a "take what you need" system.

## Part 5: The Roadmap – "How We Get There"

We don't wait for the collapse. We build the new world in the shell of the old.
