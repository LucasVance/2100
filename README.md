# 2100


> **Mission:** To dismantle the narrative that equates "Capitalism" with "Free Markets," and to demonstrate that the path to true liberty and abundance lies in dismantling state-enforced corporate privileges.

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the source code and content for a community-driven educational resource.

**Thesis:** The political divide between "Left" and "Right" is often a distraction. The real friction is between **State Capitalism** (The Rigged System) and **The People**. We explore the synthesis of "Offensive" deregulation strategies (Individualist Anarchism) with "Defensive" social protections (Libertarian Socialism) to create a roadmap for a stateless, free, and abundant society.

This project aims to be an accessible, non-academic entry point for anyone questioning the current economic status quo, specifically addressing those living within the imperial core who may be skeptical of traditional "socialist" branding.

## Contributor Style Guide

**IMPORTANT:** To maintain a cohesive voice across the project, all contributions should adhere to the following rhetorical strategies. We aim to reach skeptics, not just the converted.

### 1. The Rhetorical Strategy ("The Trojan Horse")

We avoid academic jargon that alienates working-class readers. We use populist, accessible language to explain radical economic concepts.

### 2. The Core Logic (The Synthesis)

After full true deregulation there would be a mix of the free market but also some communist structures like Noam Chomsky would advocate for with anarcho-syndicalism. Because it looks to me that they're not contradictory and both would be valuable in different scenarios.

We are reconciling two seemingly opposite views:

-   **The "Tucker" Hypothesis:** If you truly deregulate (abolish patents, banking monopolies, land titles), competition will be so fierce that profit margins fall to zero.
    
-   **The "Chomsky" Outcome:** When profit falls to zero and technology (automation) advances, we naturally achieve a post-scarcity society based on need rather than transaction.
    
-   **The Conclusion:** **Perfect Competition creates the conditions for Voluntary Communism.**
    

### 3. The "Inoculation" Method (Prefire)

**"Common Objections"** or **"Yeah, but..."** sections must be included at many relevant points.

-   We must anticipate the skeptic's objection and answer it immediately.
    
-   **Rule:** Steelman, never strawman the opposition.

## Content Outline

please add a lot on top of these. these descriptions are barely even starting ideas.

### Part 1: Capitalism is flawed - "The Game is Rigged"
There are many problems of Capitalism. For example, it results in many things being way too shitty and expensive because of monopolies. Our tax dollars are funneled into the hands of the owning class, while millions of Americans starve in the richest country in the history of the world. Our tax dollars also kill children in the middle east, as our industrial military complex secures corporate interests in other countries, ruining them and exploiting foreign citizens so they can exploit American citizens. Noam Chomsky's books are great for this, especially Understanding Power.
        

### Part 2: The Definition – "We Don't Have a Free Market"

But it doesn't have to be like this. "You wouldn't have the iPhone if not for capitalism!" Incorrect; Capitalism didn't give you the iPhone, the free market did. Capitalism gave you the overpriced, restricted, un-repairable version of the iPhone.
Corporations are legal fictions created by the State. Real markets punish inefficiency; our system bails it out. Benjamin Tucker's four monopolies. State protects large corporations, there's socialism for the rich and free market for laborers.
        

### Part 3: The False Choice – "Why We Don't Want a New Boss"

Basically  we don't have to do a Marxist-Leninist style violent revolution that so many people are afraid of. We don't have to move towards socialism, communism, again that people are so afraid of. These are authoritarian regimes and failed because they replaced CEO with bureaucrat. We don't want a different boss, we want a new boss and want to truly unleash the social equalizing and rich-making power of the truly free ("freed") market. we could also frame socialism and capitalism as similar too in their authoritarianism; "State Socialism" and "State Capitalism"
        

### Part 4: The Solution – "The Ecosystem of Freedom"

Lay out left-wing market anarchism basically (the freed market) and stuff like what benjamin tucker advocates. usury is illegitimate. true competition leads to the goals that socialists want like equality, but uses the mechanisms that are logically intuitive and philosophically libertarian, american individualist

### Part 5: The Roadmap – "How We Get There"

agorism, dual power

## Accordion Model
**Philosophy:** Our argument must be fractal. It should be simple enough for a tired worker to grasp in 30 seconds, yet rigorous enough to withstand the scrutiny of a hostile economist.

Project 2100 utilizes a modular content strategy we call **"The Accordion Model."** The central challenge of this project is addressing a highly diverse audience with varying levels of economic literacy and ideological baggage. To solve this, our content is designed to "unzip" or expand based on the user's need for depth. We do not dumb down the argument; we layer it.

This will not be a short, one-shot analysis, but the future, deeper analyses will use Deep Research (Gemini mode) multiple times on distinct subtopics to provide an incredibly detailed, yet effective, incontrovertible argument. My idea for this project is that there will be selective levels of depth: since I expect a diverse reader audience, there will be people who want to read something short, and others who require large amounts of evidence for this controversial and radical viewpoint. To address this, I'm thinking that a good way would be to have expandable levels of depth: for certain points, you could expand an argument if you're not convinced. For example, those in the younger generation don't need much convincing of the problems of capitalism, and too much time spent there would waste valuable time and attention that should be spent elsewhere. On the other hand, older generations are extremely supportive of capitalism in general, and are terrified of being anti-capitalist because of the history. Another example is that a neoliberal economist is going to need a bunch of material on how this totally free market would work, and a wage slave is gonna need pretty much nothing. The final level should just reference books on this topic, as that's way beyond what I can hope to explain and is outside the scope of this project. Each argument that the main module makes should be an overview that someone can see and potentially accept, and then reference a Deep Researched topic if they need more data.

## Execution Logic: Overlap & Flow

An interesting part of this project is going to be distinguishing the modules. They are likely to overlap to some extent, so we must think about how much overlap is the best for making the arguments. For example, some of the research opportunities targeted by Deep Research are inclined to overlap with each other, but for example it might be counterproductive to get to the possible solutions to a problem too early in the outline, but also we don't want to ban an idea until we can fully introduce it either. Do not lead with radical terminology, don't say "abolish the state" initially, say something like "end corporate subsidies" instead. (or even something simpler in the more surface-oriented parts of the accordion. By the time the reader realizes that ending subsidies requires dismantling the State's power to grant them (Module 3), they are already logically committed to the conclusion.
