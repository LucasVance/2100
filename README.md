# 2100 — The Freed Market Playbook

**Mission:** Show that left-wing market anarchism — the freed market — is a practical path out of corporate capture and bureaucratic stagnation. This project is for skeptical friends, family, and neighbors who know the current game is rigged but don't see a believable alternative.

## What's Inside

- A modular, accordion-style site (MkDocs + Material) designed for skimming and deep dives.
- Straightforward language that is pro-people and anti-privilege without drifting into academic jargon.
- Examples, receipts, and objections handled respectfully and directly.

## Content Map

- **Home:** A quick orientation to the playbook.
- **The Rigged Game:** How state-backed monopolies quietly tax our lives.
- **What the Freed Market Means:** Principles that combine voluntary exchange with mutual care.
- **Beyond the False Choice:** Why corporate capitalism vs. top-down statism is a trap.
- **The Roadmap:** Actions for individuals, communities, and policy fights that open space for cooperation.
- **Objections & Receipts:** Expandable answers to the toughest questions.
- **Dictionary of Deception:** A glossary to translate corporate and policy buzzwords.
- **Library & Further Action:** Reading lists and ways to plug in.

## Writing Approach

- **Accessible tone:** Avoid jargon; assume good faith questions.
- **Steelman objections:** Anticipate doubts and answer them in their strongest form.
- **Practical optimism:** Pair critiques with buildable alternatives.

## Development

The site uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the Material theme. To preview locally:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
mkdocs serve
```

Contributions that add examples, case studies, or translations are welcome. Share the playbook with someone who thinks there is no option beyond corporate rule or bureaucratic command.
