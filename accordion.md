# The Accordion Model: Content Strategy & Architecture

> **Philosophy:** Our argument must be fractal. It should be simple enough for a tired worker to grasp in 30 seconds, yet rigorous enough to withstand the scrutiny of a hostile economist. 

## Overview

Project 2100 utilizes a modular content strategy we call **"The Accordion Model."** The central challenge of this project is addressing a highly diverse audience with varying levels of economic literacy and ideological baggage. To solve this, our content is designed to "unzip" or expand based on the user's need for depth. We do not dumb down the argument; we layer it.

## The User Matrix (Depth Levels)

Every module in the project must be written to satisfy three distinct levels of engagement simultaneously.

### Level 1: The Headline (The "Zoomer" / The Tired Worker)
* **Target:** Short attention spans, high skepticism of authority and likely capitalism, morally driven.
* **Goal:** Validate their lived experience immediately.
* **Format:** Intuitive, effective, moral arguments. Fast reads.
* **Key Tactic:** If it feels true based on their daily struggle, they will read more.

### Level 2: The Logic (The Liberal / Conservative Uncle)
* **Target:** Educated but orthodox thinkers. They believe in the "system" but see the cracks.
* **Goal:** Provide historical context and basic economic theory to explain *why* the system is broken.
* **Format:** Long-form editorial style (The Atlantic / Substack).
* **Key Tactic:** "The History Lesson." Show that things were different in the past (e.g., the 19th-century labor movement) to prove they can be different in the future.

### Level 3: The Steel-Man
* **Target:** Academics, neoliberals, capitalist economists, and hostile skeptics.
* **Goal:** Dismantle counter-arguments with overwhelming empirical evidence.
* **Format:** Rigorous white-paper style. Heavy citations.
* **Key Tactic:** **Deep Research.** This is where we deploy the heavy artillery to make the argument incontrovertible. This is with Gemini's Deep Research capability, and Level 3 arguments are built around this Deep Research modality.

## Execution Logic: Overlap & Flow

An interesting part of this project is going to be distinguishing the modules. They are likely to overlap to some extent, so we must think about how much overlap is the best for making the arguments. For example, some of the research opportunities targeted by Deep Research are inclined to overlap with each other, but for example it might be counterproductive to get to the possible solutions to a problem too early in the outline, but also we don't want to ban an idea until we can fully introduce it either. Do not lead with radical terminology, don't say "abolish the state" initially, say something like "end corporate subsidies" instead. (or even something simpler in the more surface-oriented parts of the accordion. By the time the reader realizes that ending subsidies requires dismantling the State's power to grant them (Module 3), they are already logically committed to the conclusion.
