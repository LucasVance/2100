# The Accordion Model: Content Strategy & Architecture

> **Philosophy:** Our argument must be fractal. It should be simple enough for a tired worker to grasp in 30 seconds, yet rigorous enough to withstand the scrutiny of a hostile economist. 

## Overview

Project 2100 utilizes a modular content strategy we call **"The Accordion Model."** The central challenge of this project is addressing a highly diverse audience with varying levels of economic literacy and ideological baggage. To solve this, our content is designed to "unzip" or expand based on the user's need for depth. We do not dumb down the argument; we layer it.

This will not be a short, one-shot analysis, but the future, deeper analyses will use Deep Research (Gemini mode) multiple times on distinct subtopics to provide an incredibly detailed, yet effective, incontrovertible argument. My idea for this project is that there will be selective levels of depth: since I expect a diverse reader audience, there will be people who want to read something short, and others who require large amounts of evidence for this controversial and radical viewpoint. To address this, I'm thinking that a good way would be to have expandable levels of depth: for certain points, you could expand an argument if you're not convinced. For example, those in the younger generation don't need much convincing of the problems of capitalism, and too much time spent there would waste valuable time and attention that should be spent elsewhere. On the other hand, older generations are extremely supportive of capitalism in general, and are terrified of being anti-capitalist because of the history. Another example is that a neoliberal economist is going to need a bunch of material on how this totally free market would work, and a wage slave is gonna need pretty much nothing. The final level should just reference books on this topic, as that's way beyond what I can hope to explain and is outside the scope of this project. Each argument that the main module makes should be an overview that someone can see and potentially accept, and then reference a Deep Researched topic if they need more data.

## Execution Logic: Overlap & Flow

An interesting part of this project is going to be distinguishing the modules. They are likely to overlap to some extent, so we must think about how much overlap is the best for making the arguments. For example, some of the research opportunities targeted by Deep Research are inclined to overlap with each other, but for example it might be counterproductive to get to the possible solutions to a problem too early in the outline, but also we don't want to ban an idea until we can fully introduce it either. Do not lead with radical terminology, don't say "abolish the state" initially, say something like "end corporate subsidies" instead. (or even something simpler in the more surface-oriented parts of the accordion. By the time the reader realizes that ending subsidies requires dismantling the State's power to grant them (Module 3), they are already logically committed to the conclusion.
